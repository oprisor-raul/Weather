# Weather
A free, open-source weather app for Apple devices using Open Weather API. The app is 100% compatible with any device: iPhone, iPod, iPad, and Macbook with Silicon chip.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This simple weather app tells information about the current weather in a plain and clean format. The details include current temperature, time of sunrise, time of sunset, wind speed, and what the actual weather feels like. 
The app features 20 beautifully selected images and automatically chooses a well-fitted theme depending on the current local weather conditions. Just give permission to your location and let the app take care of the rest.

### Bottom Lines from the Project:
The main takeaway from this project is a better and much clearer understanding of the Swift programming language. Studying theory is only the foundation. Putting the knowledge into action is the main part of learning *how* to program.

A List of key details that I got a deeper understanding of:
  - Developing an iOS app that is compatible with multiple screen sizes and adapting the view for every screen size from small to big 
  - Making use of Apple's Core Location framework
  - Interpreting JSON file as a result of the API call (https://designcode.io/swiftui-advanced-handbook-data-from-json)
  - A much better organization of files in folders (Views, Managers, Extensions)
